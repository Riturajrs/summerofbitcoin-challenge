# summerofbitcoin-challenge
This is a open source challenge by Summer of Bitcoin.<br>
It is written in C++.<br>
I have used greedy algorithim for maximising the profit, which means<br>
that solution produced will not be perfect but it will be close to perfect.<br>
A better approach would be applying dynamic programming to solve it.<br>
<br>
Please contribute if you can.<br>
Thank you.
