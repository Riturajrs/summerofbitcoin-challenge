# summerofbitcoin-challenge
This is a open source challenge by Summer of Bitcoin.<br>
It is written in C++.<br>
I have used greedy algorithim for maximising the profit<br>
I have maximised the ratio of total fees from each transaction by total weight of each transaction<br>
Worst case time complexity is O( N<sup>2</sup> )
A better approach would be applying dynamic programming to solve it.<br>
<br>
Total transactions : 5214<br>
Total weight : 1769100<br>
Total profit : 1078091
